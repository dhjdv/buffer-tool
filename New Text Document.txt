The Languages Used:
HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language): Provides the structure (buttons, inputs, map container).

CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets): Handles the styling. We used the Tailwind CSS framework (loaded via CDN) for the modern look and layout.

JavaScript (ES6+): Handles all the logic (uploading files, drawing the map, calculating buffers, and generating exports).

Libraries used:

Leaflet.js: For the interactive map.

Turf.js: For the geospatial math (calculating buffer zones and areas).

Leaflet-Geoman: For the manual editing tools.

toGeoJSON: To convert your KML files into a format the code can understand.
